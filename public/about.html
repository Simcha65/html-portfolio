<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Oscar Hidalgo, and I am new to the coding world. I am very excited about this new course 
  my life has taken. Though, it is too soon to celebrate, I can only relish in that I have completed the HTML portion
  of my training, and I find coding and I to this point agree. Thus far I have been an electro-mechanical technician my whole life. 
  </p>
  <p>I have loved working in big manufacturing plants or farms repairing equipment or supervising other technicians. The
    ability to move around or work outdoors has been my fondness. However, as I near my 6th decade, I have had to face
    the changes that come with time, and I had to decide what to do with my next six decades. Lol. I have a BS in Operations
    and Project Management, which I kind of regret now, for I feel that those were lost years, which I could have focused 
    instead on Computer Science or Information Technology. Nevertheless, I am setting my goals high. Perhaps, one day I can 
    even attain a master's degree in software engineering. Wish me luck! :)
